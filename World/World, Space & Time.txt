World is limited per instance
if enabled world may connect to each other (the player changes the server as he is crossing borders)
Space may be streched, compressed twisted but never torn
Time is not linear and will split if timelines are broken 
Paradoxes do not exist since every unnatural change in time will result into the split of the time line
Magic is retained through timelines
the aging of things is the breakdown of magical structure , therefor people die of old age
Time may be affected by magic
