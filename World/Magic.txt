Magic is besides space the only constant in the universe
beings that have life force are isolated to the magic around them, since they would die if their fragile internal magic would be affeted
Implants are able to bridge that
Magic may negate everythings besides Space there is no negative space
Magicians may use catalysts to affect the magic around them
excessive use of magic may have the same effect as concentrated heat
some matter is not affected my magic due to superconduction
several organic bodies may connect to turn into one magical system
Beings that weild life force are affected by magic there is a possibility to manipulate magic current in a way that psycological effects can occur
Mages that have open wounds that are not internal while casting can lead to spontaneous combution
Magic may be produced from and turned into energy or matter


4 States of Matter
Solid object typically conduct arcana the more pure the better
fluid object don't conduuct arcana they will eighter disperse it or reflect it purity will influence the behavior with high energy the magic system can be stabilized
Gases are easy to form and it is therefor easy to cast magic through the air purity of gas will determine the flow magi system very unstable
plasma is incredably conductant and dependent on the substance and the method of containment it can have a really stable yet formable magic system and is therefor ideal for All high end spells
