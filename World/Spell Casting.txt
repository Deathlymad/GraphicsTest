Skill / Spell Properties defining casting are:
Target / Diretion
Spell types
Duration
Cast Time
Area of Effect

Magic can be imagined as waves moving around a system of lines lines are directional (vectors basicly) lines can be cahnged and modified each wave may be modified

Duration: mostly instant since spells are normally a ways of the shift of arcana and since that means a force directed against it it will grow increasingly hasrd to maintain
Cast Time: dependent on the ompexity of the System
AoE is dependent on the arcana concentration it will always try to even itself out so the more mana is used the bigger the AoE is
