live is separated in orgranic life (beings that have the ability to contain and prduce life force) and
unorganic life (beings that weren't born and who are not able to generate life force by themselfs)

beings are separated additionally into three different types: Higher beings, Lesser Beings, and No-Beings
Higher beings are literally able to bend magical streams around them according to their will
lower Beings are ableto manipulate magical streams by utilizing part of their life force that way is more immediate and powerful (exceptions are orcs, humans, dwarfs and gnomes)
Non-Beings have no life force and are therefor normally considered dead. however they can be seen alive like someone who lies in a coma. he looks dead but is alive. no-beings normally require external energy to take action. Magic can flow through them
Plants and Apex are normally onsidered non-beings
Beasts are considered lesser beings but their magic is similar to Apex
