Short Term:
	Options UI
finish Textures (TextureAtlas, multiple Samplers)
Finish window management (resizing)
Gamepad/Joystick implementation
reduce Update calls from constants like Material Data
make the Registration in the TestGame class cleaner
add Log File
decrease threads from KeyMaps (maybe move to update thread) -->ThreadServer/ThreadClient
fix button not rendering with Background
If window is deselected in the first main menu screen the input is not reacted for (NullPtrException)
make UI background modifiable

Long Term:
Physics
create Player
create World
Write Regex Algorithms to modify Shaders in order to fit them to the input Data.
write Mousehandler?!
Make the "Borders" of the Lights disappear

Very Long Term:
add comments
autonomous Threadusage and memory optimization
OpenCL
Use Vulkan




UI stuffs:
rendering a virtual mouse
make the UI able to Drag & Drop over the Screen (if not fullscreen)
keep all Data current (Options)
